Event-driven programming is a crucial concept in modern software, including embedded systems.

It became essential with the rise of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) in the 1980s.

Unlike command-line interfaces, which process inputs sequentially, GUIs introduced multiple input sources.

Users interact with the system using both the keyboard and the mouse simultaneously.

This made traditional sequential programming ineffective, as waiting for one input would ignore others.

To solve this, software needed a way to process multiple inputs without blocking execution.

The key innovation was event-driven programming, where inputs are treated as events.

Events include user actions like keypresses, mouse movements, and button clicks.

Instead of executing commands in a strict order, the software reacts to events dynamically.

Windows systems introduced the concept of an event queue to store and process events asynchronously.

This ensures that events are recorded immediately but processed when the system is ready.

Event-driven programs rely on a message loop to continuously check and handle new events.

In Windows, the GetMessage() function retrieves the next event from the queue.

If no events are available, the function blocks and waits, preventing CPU waste.

When an event is received, the DispatchMessage() function sends it to a window procedure.

The window procedure acts as the event handler and determines how to respond to different messages.

Messages include signals like WM_KEYDOWN for keypresses and WM_MOUSEMOVE for mouse activity.

Each message contains additional parameters, like which key was pressed or the mouse coordinates.

The program processes the message using a switch statement to determine the appropriate response.

Messages that are not explicitly handled are passed to the default Windows system procedure.

This hierarchical approach allows applications to inherit standard behaviors while customizing specific actions.

This method is known as Programming by Difference, as developers modify only necessary parts.

Another important concept is Inversion of Control, where the system calls the application code instead of the other way around.

Unlike traditional programming, where the program dictates execution, event-driven systems wait for user input.

This means the application does not control the flow directly but reacts to system-generated events.

One major challenge in event-driven programming is the handling of blocking operations.

Blocking functions, like sleep delays, prevent the system from processing new events.

For example, adding a Sleep(200ms) delay after a keypress would make the application unresponsive.

During this delay, other inputs accumulate in the queue, causing sudden jumps in event counters.

This issue is known as the "pig" problem, where the application becomes sluggish and unresponsive.

The solution is to use timers instead of blocking delays.

A timer schedules a future event, allowing the program to continue handling other inputs.

For example, setting a WM_TIMER event for 200ms later allows smooth execution without freezing.

Timers ensure the program remains responsive while still achieving time-dependent actions.

This highlights a critical principle of event-driven programming: never block execution.

Instead of waiting inside a function, programs should set up future events and return control immediately.

This guarantees that the system can process other inputs without interruption.

Windows applications use this principle to maintain smooth and interactive user experiences.

Event-driven programming is the foundation of real-time embedded systems as well.
